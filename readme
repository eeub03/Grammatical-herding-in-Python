Project Name: Grammatical Herding in Python


Hi, this is a tool made in Python that implements the Grammatical Herding algorithm made by Chris Headleand.
This tool was made for my 3rd year dissertation project at Bangor UNI. It currently doesn't have full functionality and
will no longer be supported or updated.

To use the tool, you need to define a fitness function, using the fitness function template, and then adjust the
parameters in the 'paramaters.py' file.

Setup.py is provided as a proof of concept. However, if it would be updated, this would allow for the tool
to be installed as a module.
