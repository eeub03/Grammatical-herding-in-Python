    From title={{An Experimental Study of N-Person Iterated Prisoner's
    Dilemma Games}}, author={Yao, X. and Darwen, P.J.}

    Each player choses cooperation(C) or defection(D). D is dominant
    for each player. Dominant strategies intersect in a deficient
    equilibrium. If all players choose C the outcome is preferable
    from every players view to the one in which everyone chooses D,
    but noone is motivated to deviate unilaterally from D

    The number of cooperators in each game is n_c. The payoff for
    cooperation is 2n_c - 2 and payoff for defection is 2n_c + 1. If
    N_c cooperative moves are made from N moves of an n-player game,
    then the average per-round payoff a is: a = 1 + N_c/N(2n-3)
